# Analysis of Land Surface Temperature (LST) and the NDVI Index from Satellite Images

## Project Description
This project involves the analysis of satellite images to calculate the Land Surface Temperature (LST) and the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), which are key indicators in environmental monitoring, agriculture, and climate studies. The script uses Landsat 8 satellite images, processing them with ArcPy and numpy libraries in a Python environment.

## Technologies
- Python 3.x
- ArcPy
- NumPy
- matplotlib (optional, if you wish to generate result visualizations)

## Requirements
To run the project, you need:
- Python installed, version 3.x
- ArcGIS environment with ArcPy installed
- NumPy library
- (Optionally) matplotlib for visualization

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository to your local environment.
2. Make sure all required libraries are installed.
3. Change the file paths in the script to match your source files.
4. Run the script using the command: `python <script_name>.py`.

## Project Structure
- `Analysis-of-Land-Surface-Temperature-LST-and-the-NDVI-Index-from-Satellite-Images` - The main script for satellite image analysis.
- `README.md` - This file.

## Results
The script generates raster files of the Land Surface Temperature (LST) and the NDVI index, which can be used for further environmental and agricultural analysis.
